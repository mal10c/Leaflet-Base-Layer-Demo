# How to run this
Download it via Git, or just download the zip file from here:
<https://github.com/mal10c/Leaflet-Base-Layer-Demo/archive/master.zip>

Extract to your server and navigate to index.html.  You should see a map that takes up the whole screen.  You should also be able to transition between base layers using the tool in the upper right corner of the screen.

If something isn't working as expected, open your browsers debug console using the F12 key.
